# Lab-Working-with-files-in-Jupyter-Notebooks
Lab: Working with files in Jupyter Notebooks


## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
*   Explore different Run Options
*   Rename your notebook
*   Shutdown your notebook
*   Save and download the notebook
*   Upload the downloaded notebook 
*   Work with multiple notebooks

## Exercise 1
### Explore different Run Options

You can explore the various run options under the **Run** menu such as <strong>Run Selected Cells, Run All cells, Run Selected Cells and Insert Below</strong> and many more.<br/>

***One such option to execute all cells by choosing <kbd>Run All cells</kbd> option from the  Run menu is illustrated below:***

You can insert a cell automatically after the execution of the code using the **Run Selected Cells and Insert Below**
* Enter the following **expression** <code>150*50</code> in the cell below and **execute** it by using the **Run Selected Cells and Insert Below**

## Exercise 2
### Rename your notebook

You can now rename your notebook to your preferred name as follows:<br/>

1. Open the **Lab: Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks** in Skills Network Labs by following these steps:

   * Click **File** menu,and select **Open From URL** option.
   *  Enter the notebook URL _https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0105EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Labs_V4/Getting_Started_with_JupyterNotebook.ipynb_ in the prompt window, and then click **Open** on the Open URL window.

   * The notebook will be loaded and opened in your lab environment.

 2. Create a new code cell before **Exercise 3** and add <code>2+9</code>. Execute the code cell and save the notebook using  **Save Notebook** or **Save Notebook as** option from the **File** menu.
 
 3. Click the **File** menu and select **Rename Notebook** to rename your notebook.

## Exercise 3
### Shutdown your notebook
You can shut down the notebook session as follows:<br/>

1. You can view the existing running sessions by clicking the **Running Terminals and Kernels** in the left navigation pane.

2. Click the **Shut Down All** option to shut down all notebook sessions.

3. To shutdown the individual notebook, click the **Shut Down** option below the cross button **(X)** next to the notebook. This helps free up the memory that the notebook is using.

## Exercise 4

###  Save and Download the notebook

Open the **Lab:Using Markdowns in Jupyter Notebooks** in Skills Network Labs by following these steps:

   * Click the **File** menu,and select **Open From URL** option.
   * Enter the notebook URL _https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0105EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Labs_V4/Using_markdowns.ipynb_ in the prompt window, and then click the **Open** button. 
Although your notebooks and data are preserved in your account after logging out, sometimes you may want to download your notebook to your computer.

- To save, click the **Save Notebook** or **Save Notebook as** button from the **File** menu.


Once you complete the lab, you can **download** the notebook as follows:

*   Select the notebook displayed in the left **Navigation pane**.

*   Right-click and select **Download** on he menu.

 *   Your notebook is downloaded to your local machine.


## Exercise 5



###  Upload the downloaded notebook 

In the previous exercise, we learned how to save and download a notebook. Now we will learn to upload a notebook to Skills Network Labs. 

To upload the notebook we have two options:

**1. Upload files option.**

**2. Drag and drop option.**

#### 1. Upload files option

* Click **Upload Files** to upload the notebook, which you had downloaded in **Exercise 2** to Skills Network.

* Browse for the notebook in your local machine and select it.

* Once the upload is complete, the notebook will appear in the Skills Network Labs left navigation pane.

* Double-click on the notebook to open and view its contents.

#### 2. Drag and drop option

* Go to file manager of your local system to view the downloaded file.

* Select the notebook and drag the file into the **file explorer** of Skills Network Labs.

## Exercise 6

### Work with multiple notebooks

You can now view your notebooks at the same time as follows:<br/>

   * Click **File** menu, and select **New view for notebook** option.
